# PoliQuest-Shadowlands
My first WoW addon.  Leveling addon for Shadowlands.

The following features work for Shadowlands quests only:
- Automatically accept and turn in quests

- Automatically select appropriate quest dialog

- Automatically set quest items on keybind-able button

- Automatically set hearthstone at Shadowlands inns (only when less than level 60 for faster leveling)

- Automatically perform emotes for quests that require it.

 

Remaining features:

- Configurable quest loot automation

- Automatically equip quest loot upgrades (no risk of equipping BOEs)

- Move button around

- Enable/disable feature sets
